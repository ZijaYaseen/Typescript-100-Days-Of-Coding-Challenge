/*Q16 - More Guests: You just found a bigger dinner table, so now more space is available. Think of three more guests to invite to dinner:

Start with your program from Exercise 15. Add a print statement to the end of your program informing people that you found a bigger dinner table.

Add one new guest to the beginning of your array.

Add one new guest to the middle of your array. â€¢ Use append() to add one new guest to the end of your list.

Print a new set of invitation messages, one for each person in your list.*/

for (let i = 0; i < guests.length; i++) {
    console.log(`${guests[i]}, would you like to join me for dinner?`);
}

console.log("\n"); // for new line

console.log(`${guests[2]} can't make it to the dinner.`);
