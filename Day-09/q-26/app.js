/*Q26 - Alien Colors #2: Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 25, and write an if-else chain.

If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.

If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.

Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.*/
var alienColor = "green";
// if chain passed
if (alienColor === "green") {
    console.log("The player just earned 5 points for shooting.");
}
else {
    console.log("The player just earned 10 points for shooting.");
}
// else chain passed
if (alienColor === "red") {
    console.log("The player just earned 5 points for shooting.");
}
else {
    console.log("The player just earned 10 points for shooting.");
